# The theory

![:scale 80%](images/EC_how_it_works.jpg)

???

# A lot of questions from researchers...

* What should be in a Data Management Plan ?
* Gathering data ? What to gather ?
* Software & scripts are also data ?
* What is metadata ? Never heard of...
* Which repository to choose ? To find & deposit
* How to deposit data & scripts ?

# The practice in life sciences

![:scale 80%](images/CONVERGE_WP3_overview.png)

???

# Complex landscape for researchers

* At all levels of the research cycle many options
* Rapidly changing landscape
* Interoperability between levels ?
* Flexibility is good, guidance is better
* Need for recommendations, best practices, examples

???

# What to use ?

* Already in use by supervisor or colleague
* Commonly used in my domain
* Offered by institute : hosted or subsidised
* I've managed to install that one
* Free online available
* Publications
* Conferences

# Software development in research

## Research Grade software

* It works today on my computer
* There might be documentation
* ...

## Professional software development

* Robustness
* Maintainance
* ...

# Software development in research

## Often a by-product, few software developers

## Open Source == just giving it all away ?

## Sustainability ? I need to solve problem X, now !

???

* Technologies are available
* Focus on green arrows: how to get it to the users ?
* User-driven developments needed

# Cloud is the future ?!

## Cloud is a disruptive concept

* How to communicate to researchers & developers
* How to transition current practices
* How about commercial licenses ?

## Services tailored for the target audience

* IAAS: freedom for developers
* SAAS: managed platforms for researchers
